# Message-passing Concurrent Language Evaluation

This repository contains a collection of programs that evaluate languages with message-passing concurrency.  The programs are designed to evaluate properties of message-passing concurrency rather than general language performance.  Furthermore, a selection of features from process calculi are examined for each language.  These are:

* Synchronous communication.
* First-order channels.
* Higher-order channels.
* First-order processes.
* Higher-order processes.
* Parallel execution statement.
* Indexed parallel execution statement.
* State ownership.
* Process ownership.
* Selection on incoming messages.
* Indexed selection.
* Selection based on incoming value.
* Guarded selection.
* Fair selection.
* Selection with timer.
* Other selection types.
* Selection of outgoing messages.
* Multi-party synchronisation.
* Selection on multi-party synchronisation.

A description of these features is provided in the appendix below.

## Classification

One of the aims of this work is the building of a classification for message-passing concurrent languages.  The hope is that an understanding of common features and different approaches can be made by investigating the approaches to message-passing concurrency.  At present, the classification is limited as only a handful of languages have been examined.  The current classification is below:



## Current Languages

The languages currently evaluated are:

- [Ada](src/ada/)
- [Erlang](src/erlang/)
- [Go](src/go/)
- [occam-_&pi;_](src/occam/)
- [Rust](src/rust/)

## Benchmark Results

There are currently three benchmark applications:

1. Communication Time.
2. Selection Time.
3. Monte Carlo _&pi;_ (for multicore support analysis).

The benchmarks are described in the appendix below.  

## Contributing to the Evaluation

If you want to help, feel free to pull the repository, implement the benchmarks, undertake the evaluation, and make a pull request.  At present, the following languages have been identified as potentially having message-passing concurrency support in the language or via the language's standard libraries.

* [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)) - the typical install is [GNAT](http://libre.adacore.com/).
* [Aha!](http://www.ahafactor.net/language).  Appears to be unavailable now.
* [AmbientTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmbientTalk) - instructions available [here](http://soft.vub.ac.be/amop/).  On analysis, AmbientTalk does not meet criteria 2 (the message must be sent in a manner so that the receiver can __choose__ when to receive it; therefore, giving the receiver control over its internal state).  This is because messages are essentially asynchronous method calls on actors, not a communication that the actor can decide when to engage in.
* [Ateji PX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateji_PX) - seems to be unavailable now.
* [Axum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum_(programming_language)) - but looks like this is [closed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd795202.aspx).
* [C=](http://www.hoopoesnest.com/cstripes/cstripes-sketch.htm) - although unsure how easy it is to communicate between concurrent components.  Appears to be unavailable now.
* [C&omega;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%CF%89) - Microsoft Research [page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/comega/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fcomega%2F).  Might not be suitable.  After some investigation, C&omega; became the [Joins Concurrency Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joins_(concurrency_library)) for .NET, although this is not a standard library and therefore does not meet the criteria.  A C&omega; compiler can be downloaded, but it requires .NET 1.1, which is no longer supported.  Thus, C&omega; has been discounted from the list.
* [CAL Actor Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAL_Actor_Language) - tricky to find an implementation.  Try [here](http://orcc.sourceforge.net/).

Concurrency seems to be provided via [SCOOP](https://www.eiffel.org/doc/solutions/Concurrent%20programming%20with%20SCOOP) but unclear if message passing is available.

Not all of these languages may support message-passing concurrency, as only a quick overview has been made.  Languages may also be missing.  If you know of a language missed please get in touch.  Also, to be included a current implementation of the language is required.  There are historic languages with message-passing concurrency, but seem to be unavailable today.  For comparison purposes, the language must run on Linux.

Language selection criteria:
* the language __must__ provide mechanisms to send a message between components as part of the core language features (e.g., keyword support and/or standard library) and not via an additional library.
* the message must be sent in a manner so that the receiver can __choose__ when to receive it; therefore, giving the receiver control over its internal state.  A method invocation on an object is therefore not a message.
* messages __must__ be any structured data type supported in the language.  Conversion to bytes, strings, or another data serialization technique is __not__ considered message-passing.

If you have to download a seperate library, or write your own functions, to achieve message-passing then the criteria does not allow the language to be included.  Future work will examine library support, but as numerous examples exist this is currently outside the scope of this work.

# Appendix

## Properties

The properties taken from process calculi are:
* __Synchronous communication__ - do communicating components wait until they are both ready to complete a communication.
* __First-order channels__ - does the language have a channel construct.
* __Higher-order channels__ - can channels send channels.
* __First-order processes__ - are processes (or threads or similar) assignable to variables.
* __Higher-order processes__ - can processes be communicated to other processes.
* __Parallel execution statement__ - can parallel execution be explicitly defined.
* __Indexed parallel execution statement__ - essentially a parallel for statement.
* __State ownership__ - does the language ensure no sharing of data between processes.
* __Process ownership__ - when a process is created it exists and is owned within the creating context.  If the containing context ends, it must wait for any owned processes.
* __Selection on incoming messages__ - the ability to select from a range of incoming message sources.  Requires first-order channels.
* __Indexed selection__ - the ability to select from an array or similar range of incoming message sources via an index.  Requires first-order channels.
* __Selection based on incoming value__ - the ability to select an incoming message based on the value in the message.
* __Guarded selection__ - the ability activate selection choices based on a boolean condition.
* __Fair selection__ - whether the selection can be considered fair (as far as possible).
* __Selection with timer__ - whether some form of timing can be used during a selection.
* __Other selection types__ - could be anything, but most likely is a default option.
* __Selection of outgoing messages__ - as input selection, but the ability to select on output.
* __Multi-party synchronisation__ - typically a barrier, but some object that allows more than two processes to synchronise at once.
* __Selection on multi-party synchronisation__ - whether the multi-party synchronisation can be used in a selection.

## Benchmarks

At present, three benchmarks have been used.

### Communication Time

This benchmark measures the communication / coordination time of a message.  Four processes are involved:
* __Prefix__ outputs 0, then outputs what it inputs.
* __Delta__ outputs its input on two channels sequentially.
* __Successor__ increments its input before output.
* __Consumer__ times how long it takes to receive _N_ inputs.

The processes are connected together to produce the natural numbers.

The Communicaton Time benchmark (also referred to as commstime) was originally developed in occam by Peter Welch at the University of Kent.

### Select Time

This benchmark measures how long it takes to select a message from a _N_ inputs.  A single reading process services multiple inputs from _N_ writers.  The reader times how long it takes to perform a single selection for different sizes of _N_.

Some languages (typically actor-based ones with mailbox systems) do not fair well when _N_ is greater than the number of threads as the reader cannot service the writers fast enough and the mailbox expands.

### Monte Carlo &pi;

A simple data-parallel benchmark designed to test if the language has multi-core support.  Speed-up measures are derived based on 2, 4, and 8 processes being run.  It is not the time taken to perform the benchmark but the speedup that is important.
